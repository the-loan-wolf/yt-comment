## !For my intended use, the app is still missing its core features:

  - Replies Comment folding
  - Deeper replies should be nested

App is live on http://3.108.218.90:4173/ but will not work correctly because I haven't provided my youtube account cookies(Don't want to get banned!). 

## Developing

Clone the project and installed dependencies with `npm install` (or `pnpm install` or `yarn`), start a development server:
(First install yt-dlp dependency or else project won't work!)

```sh
npm run dev

# or start the server and open the app in a new browser tab
npm run dev -- --open
```

## Building

To create a production version of your app:

```sh
npm run build
```

You can preview the production build with `npm run preview`.

> To deploy your app, you may need to install an [adapter](https://svelte.dev/docs/kit/adapters) for your target environment.
